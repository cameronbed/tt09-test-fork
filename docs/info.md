## How it works

Kogge-Stone adder adds two 4-bit values together. Adding each bit together two times, one with a persumed carry-in and one without. Holding the results of each addtion, for each bit, it then computes the first result and based on that result, it picks from the other pre-computed result.

## How to test
Give A and B values and observe output to expected output based on A and B.


## External hardware

No external hardware needed.
