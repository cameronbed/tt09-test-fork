In contrast to a ripple carry adder, a kogge stone adder does all calculations in parallel for each bit as if there was or was not a carry-in from the previous result. Then, after doing the first calculations of the first bits in the two binary digits, it chooses the correct results by whether there was a carry-in initialy. It is a brilliant way to speed up the calculation, reduce latency, at the cost of number of gates and power consumption.
